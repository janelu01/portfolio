### Technical Writing
I worked on a plain language description of file types so that data on the [Ontario Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/en/about#training-materials) are more accessible to the public. I have also written internal guide documents for catalogue contributors and one-pagers describing Windows 10 features.

At Jerry, I was the lead on developing a [Writer's Playbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AXB5i9ev13MaogTONPgO7yNGR4_8_Df4/view?usp=sharing), which was an onboarding document for new writers joining the team. 

I shared the materials and instructions for running the [FWD50 workshop on GitHub](https://github.com/DTS-STN/digital-service-reviews/tree/main/assets/capture-the-approval) so other government teams could replicate the activity.

### User Research
I have created user testing scripts and conducted dozens of user interviews to inform evidence-based changes to the [Ontario Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/en/about#training-materials). This includes changes to the homepage and licence presentation.
