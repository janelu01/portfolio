### Technical Writing
I worked on a plain language description of file types so that data on the [Ontario Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/en/about#training-materials) are more accessible to the public. I have also written internal guide documents for catalogue contributors and one-pagers describing Windows 10 features.

### User Research
I have created user testing scripts and conducted dozens of user interviews to inform evidence-based changes to the [Ontario Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/en/about#training-materials). This includes changes to the homepage and licence presentation.
