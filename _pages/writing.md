_With Warm Regards and Open Ears_ is a blended, personal essay that was awarded the Diaspora and Transnational Studies Prize.

**Adjudicators' comments:**

"This essay is not just beautifully written - it makes the reader think deeply about writing, about "writing to listen," and about the voice of this writer as it takes shape through the essay. The writer uses counterstory to offer detailed personal narrative as a way into critical reflections on racialization, language, family, and dissent."
