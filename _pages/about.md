I am excited about technology and using it to improve public services. I have a keen interest in the conversation around privacy and ethics as the world continues to build new digital products. I have extensive experience with user-centered design, communications, research, writing, and content creation.

Graduated with an Honours Bachelor of Arts, English RMPC with specialization in Digital Media Studies, from the University of Waterloo in 2021.
