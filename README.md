Welcome to my GitHub page! 

I am excited about technology and using it to improve public services. I have a keen interest in the conversation around how to empower teams to deliver trustworthy digital services when Canadians need them. I have extensive experience with UX, communications, research, writing, and content design.

Graduated with an Honours Bachelor of Arts, English RMPC with specialization in Digital Media Studies, from the University of Waterloo in 2021.
